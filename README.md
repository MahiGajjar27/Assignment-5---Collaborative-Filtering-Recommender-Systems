In collaborative filtering for recommender systems, we aim to predict user ratings for items (like movies) based on historical ratings. We learn two sets of parameters: item parameters (representing item features) and user parameters (representing user preferences). By minimizing a cost function, which includes regularization to prevent overfitting, we adjust these parameters using optimization techniques like gradient descent. This allows us to make personalized recommendations for unrated items to users.
